She's not the relatively unknown former state representative from the first campaign, but a leading advocate for voting rights, someone <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-stacey-abrams-georgia-voting-rights-af71ec062882dc8552fa9ccde97873ed\">credited with laying the organizational groundwork</a> for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden\">Joe Biden</a> to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia in 28 years."}, {"type": "text", "content": "But the same dynamics that lifted Abrams to national prominence four years ago could be a vulnerability in the general election in November. With her rise, she has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-business-atlanta-georgia-c4e30b9bbabb586ba1f5f5ad8cc0301c\">become a millionaire</a>, something Republicans have highlighted to portray her as out of touch, even though both leading GOP candidates for governor are far wealthier. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>, who drove suburban moderates like those around Atlanta away from the GOP, is no longer in the White House. Instead, Biden is confronting the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-approval-rating-drops-ap-norc-poll-d41bce85e1b062b588a32908b2affa65\">lowest approval numbers</a> of his presidency, alarming Democrats who fear he could drag down candidates across the country."}, {"type": "text", "content": "If she's elected, the 48-year-old Abrams would make history as the first Black woman to lead a state. But to get there, she must tap into the energy that contributed to her rise while averting the newer crosscurrents that could work against her."}, {"type": "text", "content": "\u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it: We have fundamental headwinds,\u201d said Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cWe have a whole history where Democrats have trouble winning in midterms.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Abrams' fate could hinge on whom Republicans choose as their nominee on Tuesday. If they side with incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, the race would be a rematch of the bitter 2018 campaign, which Abrams lost by 1.4 percentage points. She was defiant at the time, acknowledging Kemp as the victor but <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-america-lawsuits-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-7985be43fa4c4422bfece25cb0204307\">refusing to concede</a> the race, citing \"gross mismanagement\" in his role as secretary of state overseeing the election."}, {"type": "text", "content": "If Kemp is the nominee, he would again have the advantage of incumbency in a powerful office. He has shoved rafts of legislation through a GOP-led General Assembly and is unveiling big economic developments, like a $5.5 billion, 8,100-job Hyundai Motor plant that he announced near Savannah on Friday."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Polls so far this year show a close race, with Kemp narrowly ahead if he is the nominee. In 2018, polls usually found the race about tied, although little polling had been done this early that year, reflecting a national political establishment that didn't believe Abrams could win."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Abrams and other Democrats say they\u2019ll be ready if David Perdue wins the GOP nomination. Trump personally recruited the former U.S. senator to challenge Kemp after the incumbent governor refused to go along with Trump's push to overturn election results in Georgia."}, {"type": "text", "content": "But Abrams is eager to attack Kemp, with Groh-Wargo noting Kemp is now an incumbent with a record and saying \u201chis record is pretty out of step with Georgia voters.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "content": "Those attacks can be lacerating.

But there\u2019s a new set of issues, including crime, education and inflation."}, {"type": "text", "content": "On public safety, Abrams plans to hit Kemp on his successful push to abolish the requirement for permits to carry concealed handguns in public. And with the likelihood that the Supreme Court will overturn a nationwide right to abortion, Kemp is also likely to face flak for signing a now-frozen law that would ban abortion after six weeks in Georgia. Groh-Wargo argues that alarm over abortion rights will motivate many Democrats."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Many Georgia Democrats believe 2022 is their year of destiny. That's in part because they believe the state, on the verge of being majority nonwhite, continues to trend Democratic."}, {"type": "text", "content": "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to show everyone that it wasn\u2019t a fluke, it wasn\u2019t just about one election cycle, and it wasn\u2019t about Donald Trump,\u201d U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, also chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, told reporters at a recent state party dinner."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Even some Republicans say they believe Abrams is well positioned.

She said Abrams is open to attack for being more focused on national influence than on Georgia."}, {"type": "text", "content": "\u201cShe is looking so much past the governorship and thinking about running for president that she\u2019s not doing the work she needs to do to be governor,\" Zoller said."}, {"type": "text", "content": "To help offset that, Abrams has tried to steer clear of national politics. She was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-joe-biden-voting-atlanta-stacey-abrams-7bb6e8cd4ad78267cc56d713ecdbf39d\">noticeably absent</a> in January as Biden swung through Atlanta to press for voting rights, citing a scheduling conflict. More recently, her campaign has issued advertising trying to highlight what she's been doing outside of politics, including her business record and work on COVID-19 relief."}, {"type": "text", "content": "\u201cOur mission is to define Stacey before anybody else gets a chance to undermine her or to define here in a way that\u2019s inaccurate,\" Groh-Wargo said."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Abrams has one other potential advantage \u2014 disunity in the Republican Party."}, {"type": "text", "content": "Both Kemp and Perdue have cast their run for governor as a mission to \u201cstop Stacey,\" and heavy turnout in the GOP primary suggests many Republicans have overcome Trump-inspired misgivings about voting. But questions will remain whether Kemp, if he wins, can achieve the overwhelming party unity and turnout that may be needed to defeat Abrams. That will be especially true if Trump continues to criticize Kemp."}, {"type": "text", "content": "For now, though, the general election race is barely begun.
